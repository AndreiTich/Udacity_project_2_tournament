Welcome to the tournament python program. This is a submission for the second assignment
of the Udacity Full Stack Development NanoDegree.

In order to sucessfully run the application, make sure that the
following steps are followed.

1: Check that the following python packages are present in your python installation
	psycopg2
	itertools
	pprint
	operator

2. To set up the Postgres database for this program, you will have to run tournament.sql
   Before running it, please modify the line after the MODIFY line to make sure it connects
   to a databse which exists on the system but it not the tournament database. This is to
   ensure that if there it a tournament database it can be sucessfully re-instantiated by
   the SQL file.

   Once that is done, make sure are in the tournament project directory when you sign into
   PSQL. When you are inside you can issue the following command to create the database:

   	'\i tournament.sql'

   Without the quotation marks

3. Now that your database has been instantiated. You can run the tournament_test.py file.
   This will test the functionality of the tournament.py module.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

This module supports all of extra credit features including multiple tournaments, rematch
prevention, and odd and even number of players support. The multiple tournament support
works by having a table to relate player IDs and tournament IDs. So if a player wants to
register in two tournaments seperately, it is like registering twice as each player ID can
only be associated with one tournament ID. If I were to improve how this works I would allow
for one player ID to be part of multiple tournaments. I did not implement this however because
of the way that I count the player standings in Postgres (and the query would have gotten really
muddled up!).
